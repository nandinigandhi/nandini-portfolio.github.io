                    Observations is a project that I did in the second semester of my first year at OCADU and two years later,
                    it is still one of my favourite projects to look back on and one that made me reflect about who I was as a designer the most-
                    an important thing as someone who is just starting out their design education.

                <p>

                   This project explores the thing I struggled with the most when I started out - who am I as a designer 
                   and what are the tools I use succesfully but also what are my hinderences?

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I talk a lot about moving from the subjective into the objective. It is hard as a designer to 
                    detach yourself from your work and accept critique that will make you better not only as a designer, but 
                    as a team player. There are two major things I learned about myself going through this project:

                    <br>
                    <br>


                    — In the beginning of a project, I used to find it hard to just get into it and immerse myself
                    because I had a specific image in my mind but not all visions turn into reality and that fear hindered
                    me at the beginning. I learned that making basic design decisions like color choices, typeface choices
                    and doign visual research both in the real world and through tools on the internet, I was able to start 
                    somewhere. 

                    <br>
                    <br>


                    — I learned that a project is never done, it is just due which is to say that because the world and 
                    us humans are ever-evolving, so is our design practice and process. I still sometimes go back to old 
                    projects and work on them because my skill set is now more refined. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    All this is to say is I learned that moreso than the outcome, I grew from the process. I grew from the 
                    feedback. I grew from the evolving decisions and I am grateful to this project for showing that to me. 

                </p>
