                    This project is still being worked upon but here is a sneak-peak of what's going on!

                </p>

                <a href="#" class="work">
                    <img src="#" alt="">
                </a>

                <p>

                    —Touch, taste, sight, sound, smell. These are my senses. These shape my experiences. They have colours. The colour of a sound, the touch that reminds me that I’m alive, the smell that reminds me of you, the taste that imparts flavour, and the sight that lets me see. I am the product of my experiences but I am more than my senses and even my senses are shaped by who I am. Who am I?

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Who am I? I am a witness, I am an observer. I look and I see. I do and I am. 
                    I can just be. To be. To hold. To behold. 
                    I can hold, I can absorb. I am a vessel, I am a sponge. Some things slide over the surface while others find a home deep under my skin and remain as voices in my head, disproving and tormenting. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I have space in my body, in my mind, in my consciousness, to hold things, to absorb things but I cannot always choose. 
                    My reality exists within my consciousness. 
                    Consciousness is a fleeting thought, an abstraction, a moment in time. What is real? What isn’t? I question facts. What are facts but shared experiences? What are experiences but the abstraction of our consciousness? 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I am a prisoner of my consciousness - it is all I can understand, all I can see. I am held captive by what my consciousness can derive from my senses. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I have three selves- my physical self, my emotional self, and my witness self. My witness self is a state of pure awareness - I am साक्षी (Saakshi). Sometimes they take advantage of me, they try to take the things I have seen and use them but they will never see what I do. All I have to offer, all I have to give is a product of my senses and my consciousness. This can never be replicated. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I am a witness to my life. My life passes and I watch. I watch myself go through the motions they expect me to. I watch myself fit in all the boxes they put me in. Choose a box. Check one, check two. Its all the same after a point, what you are allowed to witness is controlled. You see what they tell you. Not me, I am free. Free from them, free from myself. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I am a witness. I share many experiences but I see is mine.
